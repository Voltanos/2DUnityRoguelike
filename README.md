This is a 2D Roguelike game I made in Unity 3D. I finished this in 2018 and started it in 2014. It has examples of (at the time) my understanding of SOLID and Domain Driven Design framework implemented in this game.

There is no story as this serves more as a Proof of Concept. The player navigates around a procedurally generated map fighting against trolls and orcs while collecting items. There is a character development system along with small modifiers placed on items to make them better. This game also has examples of inventory management, saving/loading, and handling AI through a state-class design pattern.

You will need Unity 3D to open up this project, but any text editor can look over the code.
